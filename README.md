# XSamples

## Summary

XSamples provides a collection of *XWindows* starter code that works with the XGameLib library. The XGameLib library powers the XPlatformer project. All the examples make use of the XLib API (XOrg) and focus on code that was developed in the XPlatformer project (or planned to be used). The point of the examples is to demonstrate how to use the XGameLib library.

## Getting Started

To make ("compile and link") an example, use the included makefile with
the name of cpp file passed as a variable. For example, to make null.cpp:

```bash
make NAME="null"
```

Then, to run:

```bash
./null
```

Or you can even do it one step:

```bash
make run NAME="null"
```

For a full list of the examples, see [docs/examples.md](docs/examples.md).
